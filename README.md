# Project: Experipets

## üéÆ About The Project

Experipets is a virtual pet management game where players take on the role of a junior employee at a mysterious creature experimentation company. The core gameplay revolves around caring for a unique "experiment" by managing its needs, completing daily tasks, and uncovering the story, all through the interface of a retro-style desktop operating system.

The game features a single-scene structure, allowing for seamless navigation between a main desktop, the pet care application, and a virtual shop.

The game also features a unique visual style where the pet and its interface are presented on a virtual computer screen within a 3D environment.

### Current Features (Prototype v0.4)

* **OS-Style UI Navigation:**
    * A complete, single-scene UI managed by a `ViewManager`.
    * Features a Login Screen, a main Desktop View with app icons, and separate "applications" for Pet Care and the Shop.
* **Advanced Pet Care System:**
    * A virtual pet with Hunger, Cleanliness, and Happiness stats.
    * **Feed Interaction:** A fully functional drag-and-drop system for feeding items to the pet.
    * **Clean Interaction:** A "drag-and-rub" system for cleaning the pet with specific items.
* **Complete Game Loop:**
    * A "Game Over" state is triggered when any stat reaches zero.
    * Features a complete game over sequence, including UI feedback and a scene reset that returns the player to the login screen.
* **Dynamic Task System:**
    * A robust `TaskManager` that daily minor tasks and one major task per chapter.
    * Chapter progression is now tied to completing major tasks, not the day number.
    * The "Shut Down" button now correctly manages the end-of-day sequence, stat decay, and task refreshing.

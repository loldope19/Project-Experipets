# Project: Experipets

## üéÆ About The Project

Experipets is a virtual pet management game currently in its early prototype stage. Players take on the role of a junior employee at a creature experimentation company, tasked with the wholesome job of caring for unique "experiments." The core gameplay revolves around maintaining the well-being of these creatures by attending to their basic needs.

The game features a unique visual style where the pet and its interface are presented on a virtual computer screen within a 3D environment.

### Current Features (Prototype v0.2)

* **Virtual Pet & Core Needs:** A single "experiment" (pet) entity with depleting Hunger, Cleanliness, and Happiness stats.
* **3D Environment with World-Space UI**
    * The pet and its core interface are presented on a virtual computer monitor.
    * A **3D Shop Environment** is located behind the player, accessible via a smooth 180-degree camera rotation.
* **Shop System:**
    * Players can spend currency to purchase items.
    * The shop UI is dynamically generated from item data and presented on world-space canvases attached to 3D shelves.
    * Features a horizontally scrollable UI to accommodate many items.
* **Inventory System:**
    * **Item Stacking:** The inventory now correctly stacks items of the same type (e.g., "Apple x4").
    * **Contextual Display:** The inventory panel appears at the top of the screen when the "Feed", "Clean", or "Play" buttons are pressed.
    * **Category Filtering:** The inventory intelligently shows only the relevant items for the chosen action (e.g., only "Food" items appear when "Feed" is pressed).
* **Unique "Pet on Screen" Environment:**
    * A basic 3D scene with a desk and computer.
    * The pet and all its UI elements are rendered on a World Space Canvas, appearing as if they are on the 3D computer's monitor.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Future Plans for Basic Version & Beyond)

* **[X] Currency System:** *Implemented. Though not shown in UI yet.*
* **[X] Shop System:** *Implemented.*
* **[ ] Task/To-Do System:** (As per original concept) Implement a list of objectives for the player to complete each day.

    * Implement offline progression (needs continue to change while the game is closed).
* **[ ] Basic Pet Animations:** Simple idle, eating, cleaning, playing animations.
* **[ ] Advanced Interactions:**
    * Implement drag-and-drop item usage.
    * Different cleaning actions.
    * Simple mini-games for the "Play" interaction.
